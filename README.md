# PythonProjects
ðŸ’»	Some Python projects I have worked on!
Here are some of my biggest projects:
- [Encription and Decription program](https://github.com/lizgandolfi/PythonProjects/blob/main/CodedCorrespondence.py): A Python program for decoding and encoding messages.
- [Availability Organization and Newsletter program](https://github.com/lizgandolfi/PythonProjects/blob/main/Organization%20and%20Email%20Newsletter.py): A Python program for cross-referencing people's availability in order to organize an event, then creating an automatically updated newsletter based on the days and participants.
